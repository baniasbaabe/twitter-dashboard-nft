## 💹 Overview

With the hype around AI and Data Science, more and more people want to apply these methods for their own use case. For people who do not come from the tech sector, the application can be difficult due to a lack of programming skills. This web app aims to make this easier. Data Science should be more accessible for all people.

Although the hype around NFT flattened a bit, trading with them made people rich AF! With this NFT Twitter Dashboard, you can analyze tweets about a specific NFT project (e.g. DeGods). See, what people are saying. Use it for yourself. Back your decisions by the sentiment of the community.
